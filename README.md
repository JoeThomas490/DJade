# DJade

DJade is my first python application and is used to help organize music into labeled folders and manage mp3 tags. DJade is mainly focused towards helping DJ's organize their music as keeping on top of music as it's being downloaded en masse is quite a task. There will be the ability to set BPM's, modify genre's and sort into genre folders, as well as change the format of how to name their songs to make it easier when using CDJ's.

For now this is only compatible with .mp3 files but support for .wavs etc. will be added in the future.
