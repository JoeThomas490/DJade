# DJade
DJade is my first python application to help organize music into correct folders and manage tags. DJade is mainly focused towards helping DJ's organize their music as there will be the ability to set BPM's, modify Genre's and sort into genre folders, as well as change the format of how to name their songs to make it easier when using CDJ's.
